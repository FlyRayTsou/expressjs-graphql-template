# expressjs-api-template
I am building an API template using Express.js and TypeScript to streamline future development projects.
You could clone this repository and develop new API as you want.

# How to start

1. install packages: `% npm install`
2. Start Server:
   - Not hot reloading: `% npm exec tsx ./src/app.ts`
   - Have hot reloading: `% npx nodemon`

# How to check coding convension

`% npx eslint`

# How to run unit test

(To be updated)

# How to debug with Visual Studio Code

There are already necessary settings (launch.json and tasks.json).
So you just need to click the left sidebar `Run and Debug` and click the green play button.
